### Software Engineer · Full Stack .NET Developer · Open Source Advocate

I am a Medellín-based software engineer with 5+ years delivering maintainable .NET solutions and modern web applications. My work balances the rigor of software engineering with the community spirit of open source—leveraging GNU/Linux, contributing to collaborative projects, and championing transparent, reliable systems that help teams ship with confidence.

## What drives me
- **Purposeful engineering:** Applying SOLID principles, clean architectures, and automated pipelines so software remains robust and adaptable.
- **Open source mindset:** Inspired by GNU and the broader Linux ecosystem, I love learning from community standards, giving back through docs and code, and adopting practices that make contributions inclusive.
- **Team-first delivery:** Clear communication, practical documentation, and mentoring to keep projects moving quickly without sacrificing quality.

## Technical focus
- **Backend:** .NET (ASP.NET Core, .NET 5/6), C#, RESTful APIs, microservices, Entity Framework, SQL Server, MySQL, MongoDB.
- **Frontend:** Angular, Vue.js, SPA patterns, responsive UI fundamentals.
- **DevOps & Platforms:** Azure DevOps, CI/CD, Docker, Azure App Service, Azure SQL, Linux-first development environments.
- **Practices:** Code reviews, unit/integration testing, performance tuning, observability basics, IaC-friendly architectures.

## Recent impact
